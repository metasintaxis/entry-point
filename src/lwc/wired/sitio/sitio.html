			<h2>The Self In The Wired</h2>
			<p>
				<i>The Wired</i> is a metaphor in the Serial Experiments Lain
				series that represents a dream/desire of individuals to
				materialize themselves in an omnipresent digital world. Since
				The Wired eventually gets merged with the physical world, the
				individuals that can manipulate the Wired could also modify the
				reality that initially scared them. I think that any portfolio
				or profile in our network responds to this desire of being
				present in every place, at any time, even in the long past of
				future generations.
